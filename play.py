'''2. Create a game, where a user has to get through as many items in 
the list (i.e. answer them correctly, and when they ultimately fail, then they get
a high score which also forces them to continue practicing the words)

2.1 is to create a functions to read both the long list of space-repeated
words so that we can loop over them and test the user continously until they fail, at which point
we give them a score, and also definitions so that we may show a user a word definition
if its their first time encountering the word.

#2.2 define a continous while loop that tests the user
on each word inthe list, one after the other in the provided order, and will only
exit when each word has been mastered, or the user makes a mistake
2.3 print the new high score when they fail or win, and also a command to start again
